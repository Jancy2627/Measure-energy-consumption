# Measure-energy-consumption
#Algorithm:
   Linear regression algorithm is used for this measure energy consumption project.
#Pakages:
    PySerial: This package can be used to communicate with energy meters or sensors that provide data on energy consumption.

pandas: You can use pandas to manipulate and analyze data collected from energy meters or sensors. It's great for data preprocessing and analysis.

Matplotlib or Seaborn: These packages are useful for data visualization, allowing you to create plots and graphs to better understand energy consumption trends.

numpy: numpy is essential for numerical operations and calculations, which may be necessary for energy consumption analysis.

scipy: If you need to perform scientific and statistical calculations on your energy consumption data, scipy can be quite helpful
